                            about what judith said, I do so have a soul. Thank you very much. And I
                            didnt mean a litteral cage...(unless of course, that is the price to
                            pay for kong.). I actually happen to Love 2-D more than my current
                            boyfriend, so judith can put a sock in it. If i had to put 2-D in a
                            cage...it would most likely just be a bedroom with barred windows(unless
                            murdoc said otherwise. After all, Murdoc is GOD.) And i have never
                            risked losing my soul before now. Its just that...well..gorillaz are
                            special to me, and I happen to know that kong is not easy to get away
                            from. Once you go there once, its hard to stay away from. Meaning, I
                            will gladly give Kong back if you ever needed it again. And you wouldnt
                            need to give back anying I used to pay for the place. So I say BLAH!!!

                            opportunity such as this and didn't plan ahead) and i have nothing else
                            of value, other than a 2002 mustang in good working order (with slight
                            body damage) and a modest-sized music collection. (it's good music
                            though, from a plethora of genres and eras) i can go so far as to throw
                            in my undying devotion, affection, and servitude (you know, cooking,
                            cleaning, errands, etc. i'll follow you to the end of time just to keep
                            your toenails trim.) any demeaning activity you can concoct is fine by
                            me, so long as you keep making albums. whether or not a deed changes
                            hands is of little concern to me.

                            have to pay him. That being said, Ill give up my soul(i dont fink it
                            ever been used), my freinds soul(whidh i bought from him last year for a
                            quarter), and...lets see...since you hate 2-D,Mr. Niccals, I'll take
                            him off your hands. He will only be of some bother to you when you need
                            him to sing. That why, the band can still eat orphans while you live
                            peacfully at home with no blue haired ponce to bother you.
                            I would take the rest of em, too, but i have a rather small house. Its
                            already to the point where 2-D would have to sleep in my room in a
                            small cage. He can live of oyster crackers.
                            What d'ya say? Nice bargain, yeah?
                            I swear to never let him outside, that way, he'll get pale and creepy
                            looking so that when compared, you are definatley the better looking one
                            on stage (more birds!).
                            So, thats my offer; doom for 2-D and two souls. Well...3 if you
                            consider that since 2-D would be my property, i can give you HIS soul
                            too. Sounds nice, dosnt it, Niccals?</td>

                            man! how much? , is a good place, more than 30 rooms , an a box office,
                            very isolated (i hate neighborhoods), a carpark. bunker,and a good
                            architecture, mmh , in the hell hole i can fry sausages :) but the
                            problem is the gay polar bear and the zombie and demon infestation.
                            I give a million of dolars for the Studio (in little pays of 2
                            dollars for a week) but the price needs a bit less for the infestations
                            an the conditions of the place.

                            Fans of gorillaz when anybody get the Kong Studios make a party and
                            invite me!
